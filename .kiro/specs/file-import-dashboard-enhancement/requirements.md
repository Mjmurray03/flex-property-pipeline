# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The File Import Dashboard Enhancement extends the existing Interactive Filter Dashboard to include file upload capabilities, creating a complete end-to-end workflow. Users will be able to upload their own Excel files, have them processed and validated, then use the full filtering and export capabilities without requiring any hardcoded file paths. This enhancement transforms the dashboard into a fully self-contained application.
