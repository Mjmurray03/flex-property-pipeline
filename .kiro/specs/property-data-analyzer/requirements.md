# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the loading and analysis of private property data from Excel files to identify and categorize flex industrial properties. The system will provide comprehensive data structure analysis, property type identification, and data quality assessment to support real estate investment decision-making.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a real estate analyst, I want to load property data from Excel files, so that I can analyze large datasets of property information efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Excel file path is provided THEN the system SHALL load the data into a pandas DataFrame
2. WHEN the data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display the total number of properties and columns
3. WHEN the data is loaded THEN the system SHALL show data types and non-null counts for all columns
4. IF the file path is invalid or file cannot be read THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a real estate analyst, I want to identify industrial property types in the dataset, so that I can focus on relevant properties for investment analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing property types THEN the system SHALL identify all unique property types and their counts
2. WHEN searching for industrial properties THEN the system SHALL use keywords including 'industrial', 'warehouse', 'distribution', 'flex', 'manufacturing', 'storage', and 'logistics'
3. WHEN industrial properties are found THEN the system SHALL display the property type and count for each industrial category
4. WHEN no industrial properties are found THEN the system SHALL indicate that no industrial properties were detected

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a real estate analyst, I want to assess data completeness for key fields, so that I can understand the quality and reliability of the dataset.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking data completeness THEN the system SHALL analyze key fields including 'Building SqFt', 'Property Type', 'Sale Date', 'Sold Price', 'Year Built', 'Lot Size Acres', 'Zoning Code', and 'County'
2. WHEN analyzing each field THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the percentage of non-null values
3. WHEN analyzing each field THEN the system SHALL show the absolute count of properties with data for that field
4. IF a key field is missing from the dataset THEN the system SHALL skip that field and continue with available fields

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a real estate analyst, I want to view sample industrial properties with key details, so that I can quickly assess the types of properties available in the dataset.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN industrial properties are identified THEN the system SHALL filter the dataset to show only industrial properties
2. WHEN displaying sample properties THEN the system SHALL show at least the first 10 industrial properties
3. WHEN displaying sample properties THEN the system SHALL include columns for 'Property Name', 'Property Type', 'Building SqFt', 'City', and 'State'
4. WHEN no industrial properties exist THEN the system SHALL indicate that no sample properties can be displayed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a real estate analyst, I want the system to handle errors gracefully, so that I can troubleshoot issues and continue my analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error with appropriate detail
2. WHEN file loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on file path or format issues
3. WHEN column names don't match expected values THEN the system SHALL continue processing with available columns
4. WHEN data processing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL complete partial analysis and report what was successful
