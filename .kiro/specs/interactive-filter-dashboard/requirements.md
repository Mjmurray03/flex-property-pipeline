# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interactive Filter Dashboard is a web-based application built with Streamlit that provides users with an intuitive interface to filter, analyze, and visualize property data. The dashboard will enable real estate professionals and analysts to interactively explore property datasets, apply multiple filters simultaneously, and export filtered results for further analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a real estate analyst, I want to load property data from Excel files, so that I can analyze large datasets without manual processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically load property data from a specified Excel file path
2. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL display a loading spinner with appropriate messaging
3. WHEN data loading fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and graceful fallback
4. WHEN data is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL cache the data for improved performance
5. WHEN numeric columns contain text formatting THEN the system SHALL clean and convert them to proper numeric types

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a property investor, I want to filter properties by multiple criteria simultaneously, so that I can find properties that meet my specific investment requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide filter controls for property type, building size, lot size, sale price, and year built
2. WHEN I select industrial keywords THEN the system SHALL filter properties containing those keywords in the property type field
3. WHEN I adjust building size sliders THEN the system SHALL filter properties within the specified square footage range
4. WHEN I set lot size parameters THEN the system SHALL filter properties within the specified acreage range
5. WHEN I enable price filtering THEN the system SHALL filter properties within the specified price range
6. WHEN I enable year built filtering THEN the system SHALL filter properties within the specified year range
7. WHEN I apply filters THEN the system SHALL update results in real-time and display filtered property count

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a market researcher, I want to view comprehensive analytics and visualizations of filtered property data, so that I can identify market trends and patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display building size distribution as a histogram
2. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display property type distribution as a pie chart
3. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display year built distribution as a histogram
4. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display sale price distribution as a box plot
5. WHEN data is insufficient for a chart THEN the system SHALL handle missing data gracefully
6. WHEN charts are displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate labels and titles without special characters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a geographic analyst, I want to see the geographic distribution of filtered properties, so that I can understand regional property concentrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing geographic distribution THEN the system SHALL display top 20 counties by property count as a horizontal bar chart
2. WHEN viewing geographic distribution THEN the system SHALL display top 20 cities by property count as a vertical bar chart
3. WHEN I filter by counties THEN the system SHALL allow multi-select county filtering
4. WHEN I filter by states THEN the system SHALL allow multi-select state filtering
5. WHEN geographic data is missing THEN the system SHALL handle null values appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to export filtered property data in multiple formats, so that I can use the results in other analysis tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to export data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV download functionality
2. WHEN I want to export data THEN the system SHALL provide Excel download functionality
3. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include timestamps in filenames to prevent overwrites
4. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include all filtered properties without row limits
5. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL display a filter summary showing applied criteria

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want an intuitive and responsive interface, so that I can efficiently navigate and use all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a clean interface without emoji or special unicode characters
2. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL organize content in logical tabs for data table, analytics, geographic distribution, and export
3. WHEN viewing data tables THEN the system SHALL allow column selection for customized views
4. WHEN viewing large datasets THEN the system SHALL limit initial display to 100 rows for performance
5. WHEN using filters THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback on applied filters and results
6. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL display key metrics including total properties, industrial properties, average building size, and unique cities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle data quality issues gracefully, so that users can work with real-world imperfect datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing numeric columns THEN the system SHALL remove currency symbols, commas, and percentage signs
2. WHEN encountering null values THEN the system SHALL replace various null representations with proper null values
3. WHEN data conversion fails THEN the system SHALL use error handling to prevent application crashes
4. WHEN columns are missing THEN the system SHALL conditionally display features based on data availability
5. WHEN invalid data ranges are detected THEN the system SHALL set reasonable default ranges for sliders and filters
