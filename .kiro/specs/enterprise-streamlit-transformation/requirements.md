3. WHEN performance metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL show key performance indicators with real-time updates
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive reports with metadata and quality metrics
5. WHEN data is exported THEN the system SHALL support multiple export formats (CSV, Excel, PDF) with enhanced metadata
6. WHEN historical analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain data versioning and change tracking

### Requirement 7: Enterprise Integration and API

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want RESTful API endpoints and webhook support, so that the system can integrate with other enterprise applications and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external systems need access THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful API endpoints for all major operations
2. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL support webhook notifications for integration with external workflows
