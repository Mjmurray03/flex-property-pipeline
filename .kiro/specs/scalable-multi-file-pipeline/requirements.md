# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a scalable pipeline system that can automatically process multiple property export files with the same format, aggregate results across all files, and generate comprehensive reports. The system builds on existing flex property classification capabilities to handle batch processing of large datasets from multiple sources while providing deduplication, aggregation, and summary reporting functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a real estate investor, I want to process multiple Excel files in a batch operation, so that I can analyze large volumes of property data from different sources efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline starts THEN the system SHALL scan a specified input folder for all Excel files (*.xlsx)
2. WHEN Excel files are found THEN the system SHALL display the total count of files to be processed
3. WHEN processing each file THEN the system SHALL load the data and apply flex property classification
4. WHEN processing each file THEN the system SHALL add source file information to track data origin
5. WHEN a file fails to process THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining files
6. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL report successful and failed file counts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a real estate investor, I want to aggregate results from multiple files into a single dataset, so that I can analyze all flex properties across different data sources together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all files are processed THEN the system SHALL combine all flex property results into a single DataFrame
2. WHEN combining results THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate properties based on Address, City, and State combination
3. WHEN combining results THEN the system SHALL preserve the highest flex score for duplicate properties
4. WHEN combining results THEN the system SHALL sort the final dataset by flex score in descending order
5. WHEN no flex properties are found THEN the system SHALL report zero results with clear messaging
6. WHEN aggregation is complete THEN the system SHALL save the combined results to a master Excel file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a real estate investor, I want to generate comprehensive summary reports across all processed files, so that I can understand the overall quality and distribution of flex opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating summary reports THEN the system SHALL calculate total unique flex properties found
2. WHEN generating summary reports THEN the system SHALL show average building size and lot size across all properties
3. WHEN generating summary reports THEN the system SHALL provide score distribution counts (8-10, 6-8, 4-6 score ranges)
4. WHEN generating summary reports THEN the system SHALL count unique states and counties covered
5. WHEN generating summary reports THEN the system SHALL display the number of source files processed
6. WHEN generating summary reports THEN the system SHALL show top 10 highest-scoring properties with key details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a real estate investor, I want configurable input and output paths, so that I can adapt the pipeline to different folder structures and naming conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the pipeline THEN the system SHALL accept a configurable input folder path (default: 'data/raw')
2. WHEN initializing the pipeline THEN the system SHALL accept a configurable output file path (default: 'data/exports/all_flex_properties.xlsx')
3. WHEN the input folder doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create the folder or provide clear error messaging
4. WHEN the output folder doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create the necessary directory structure
5. WHEN file paths are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with suggested corrections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a real estate investor, I want progress tracking and detailed logging, so that I can monitor pipeline execution and troubleshoot issues with large batch operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL display progress for each file being processed
2. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL show the number of flex candidates found per file
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including file name and error type
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide execution time and performance metrics
5. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL provide memory usage warnings if needed
6. WHEN the pipeline completes THEN the system SHALL generate a processing log with all operations performed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a real estate investor, I want data validation and quality checks across multiple files, so that I can ensure consistency and reliability of aggregated results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple files THEN the system SHALL validate that all files have compatible column structures
2. WHEN processing multiple files THEN the system SHALL report any schema differences between files
3. WHEN aggregating data THEN the system SHALL validate data types and handle inconsistencies gracefully
4. WHEN duplicate detection runs THEN the system SHALL report the number of duplicates found and removed
5. WHEN data quality issues are found THEN the system SHALL log warnings but continue processing
6. WHEN final results are generated THEN the system SHALL provide data quality metrics for the aggregated dataset
