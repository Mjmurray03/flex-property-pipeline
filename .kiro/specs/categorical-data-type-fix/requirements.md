## Introduction

The Categorical Data Type Fix addresses critical runtime errors in the Interactive Filter Dashboard where pandas categorical data types cause failures in numerical operations and comparisons. The system currently crashes when attempting to calculate means on categorical columns or apply numerical filters to categorical data, preventing users from successfully using the filtering functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want the system to handle categorical data types properly, so that I can calculate statistics without encountering runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters categorical data in numeric columns THEN it SHALL convert them to proper numeric types before calculations
2. WHEN calculating mean values on price columns THEN the system SHALL ensure the column is numeric before applying the mean function
3. WHEN calculating mean values on size columns THEN the system SHALL ensure the column is numeric before applying the mean function
4. WHEN categorical data cannot be converted to numeric THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and display "N/A"
5. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL verify data types before performing any mathematical operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a property analyst, I want price filtering to work correctly with all data types, so that I can filter properties by price range without encountering comparison errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying price filters THEN the system SHALL ensure price columns are numeric before comparison operations
2. WHEN price data is stored as categorical THEN the system SHALL convert it to numeric format before filtering
3. WHEN price comparisons fail due to data type issues THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and continue operation
4. WHEN price data contains non-numeric values THEN the system SHALL handle conversion errors gracefully
5. WHEN price filtering is applied THEN the system SHALL validate data types and provide appropriate user feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a real estate professional, I want all numerical filters to work consistently, so that I can analyze properties without worrying about data type compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying building size filters THEN the system SHALL ensure size columns are numeric before comparison
2. WHEN applying lot size filters THEN the system SHALL ensure lot size columns are numeric before comparison  
3. WHEN applying year built filters THEN the system SHALL ensure year columns are numeric before comparison
4. WHEN applying occupancy filters THEN the system SHALL ensure occupancy columns are numeric before comparison
5. WHEN any numerical filter encounters categorical data THEN the system SHALL convert or handle it appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive data type validation and conversion, so that the dashboard works reliably with various data sources and formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL identify and catalog all categorical columns that should be numeric
2. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL implement a robust data type conversion pipeline
3. WHEN data type conversion fails THEN the system SHALL log the issue and continue with graceful degradation
4. WHEN displaying data quality information THEN the system SHALL report on data type conversions performed
5. WHEN data contains mixed types THEN the system SHALL standardize them to the most appropriate type

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want clear feedback about data processing, so that I understand when data type issues are encountered and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data type conversions occur THEN the system SHALL provide informational messages about the conversions
2. WHEN categorical data is detected in numeric columns THEN the system SHALL warn the user and explain the automatic conversion
3. WHEN data type issues prevent certain operations THEN the system SHALL clearly explain what functionality is affected
4. WHEN all data type issues are resolved THEN the system SHALL confirm successful data processing
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL ensure all exported columns have appropriate data types
